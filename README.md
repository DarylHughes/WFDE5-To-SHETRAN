# WFDE5-To-SHETRAN


This project simply shares some code that:
- takes global bias-corrected precipitation data from WFDE5  (Cucchi et al. 2020) NB this requires some GIS pre-processing, described in a future publication
- translates this into a format suitable for SHETRAN (Newcastle University, 2023)

This is useful for driving SHETRAN models.

Please contact me if you have any feedback
If you use the code for publications, please acknowledge this URL for the time being
